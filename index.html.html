<h2>Dark/Light Mode</h2>
<p>Black and white is a metaphor used to say that something is always one way or the other, right or wrong, no in-between. 
Saying this means that love is either done a right way or a wrong way..</p>

<p>Black represents depth, mystery, and passion in love
Black, often associated with darkness, carries deep meaning in love. It represents the deep emotions that love can produce throughout a relationship. 
The black in love represents sincere desire, a burning flame that consumes. 
Black also symbolizes the mysterious nature of love, the unknown territories of the heart that draw us in and question us to explore beyond the surface.
 It represents the strength and stability that love requires. 
Just like the night sky, love can guide you through darkness and tension, appearing even stronger on the other side. It represents the ability to bear hardships, and storms in a relationship, 
and overcome obstacles that we generally face in a relationship.</p>
